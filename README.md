### WELCOME!!! 🌍

I'm Chiaki! I'm a graduate student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, major in software engineering.:D

-  Currently I'm fully curious about how to enhance painting/animating workflow between artists and their ideal results! Therefore I spent some time in making my HCI demo:>
-  I have played various games on PC, AND I have played League of Lengends for over 3000 hours.


### wait, am i coding for graphics?
