### WELCOME!!! 🌍

I'm Chiaki! I'm a graduate student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, major in software engineering.:D

-  Currently I'm fully curious about using AI technology to enhance painting/animating workflow between artists and their ideal results! It will be even better if i can accelerate their modeling!
-  I'm interedted in interaction with MR, therefore I'm spending some time in making my AR painting demo:>
-  I have played various games on PC, and I have played League of Legends for over 5000 hours.


### wait, am i coding for graphics?
